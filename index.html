     <p class="description">The common leopard gecko or spotted fat-tailed gecko is a cathemeral, ground-dwelling lizard that  have the ability to voluntarily detach their tails if it is attacked or exposed to life danger. The tail will start to regenerate immediately because it is needed for survival. This is called caudal autotomy. </p>
